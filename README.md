Supreme In-Store Sign-Up Script


Step One: 

Download all required libraries from the requirements.txt file.

Step Two:

Create a folder to move SIGNUP.py and chromedriver.exe into. (***I wanted to make it easier for people with no coding experience so I refrained from adding the chromedriver.exe to PATH.***)

Step Three:

Within that same folder, create another folder for billing profiles. Copy the path from that folder and edit the script accordingly.
(***If you have never edited a script before, this may be difficult.***)

Step Four:

Run the script. 

***IMPORTANT*** 

In order for the script to work, you must create a billing profile first. It prompts you through the creation process once you start the script.
